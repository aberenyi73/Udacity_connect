    "* KNN's pros are that it is simple and powerful. There is no training is necessary and there is no need to tune for complex parameters (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-097-prediction-machine-learning-and-statistics-spring-2012/lecture-notes/MIT15_097S12_lec06.pdf)\n",
    "* KNN's cons are that prediction time complexity is proportional to training data set size. \n",
    "* KNN may be a good choice for classification because we have many data points. A large enough K can be chosen to average over local points and smooth out high variace issues.
